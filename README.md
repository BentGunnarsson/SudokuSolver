# SudokuSolver

Simple sudoku solver, using recursion, with in-terminal visualizer

To solve your sudoku puzzle:

1. Fill in this format: (easily visualized with an IDE or text editor such as VSC)

custom_grid = [
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

2. Replace the "custom_grid" with the one you just made.
3. Run the program and pick puzzle nr. 2
4. Watch it go :)

You can make it faster by removing line 66 but that makes it harder to follow.
