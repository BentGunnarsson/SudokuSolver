# SudokuSolver

Simple sudoku solver, using recursion, with in-terminal visualizer

To solve your sudoku puzzle:

1. Fill in this format:

zero_grid = [
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

2. Replace the "numeric grid" with the custom one you just made.
3. Run the program and pick puzzle nr. 2
4. Watch it go :)

You can make it faster by removing line 66 but that makes it harder to follow.
